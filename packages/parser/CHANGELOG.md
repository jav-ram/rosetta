# @rosetta/parser

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e823b89: The AST now holds what the reader sees: backslash escapes are removed and character references resolved in text, link addresses and titles, and image alt text (as in the HTML). This makes the spec's `\::name` escape work. The AST also reports list tightness, raw front matter, raw attribute text and raw data bodies.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e3720d: Compile the parser to WebAssembly (`parser-wasm`) with a typed `parse(markdown) -> { html, ast, warnings }` client; the golden suite passes through it. The parser now returns the AST in the contracts Document shape. Contracts compiles its JSON Schemas lazily (no work at import time) and `M1Components()` no longer validates on every call. Contracts gets a Node-only `@rosetta/contracts/conformance` entry so TypeScript parsers can run the golden suite.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e8a3e4e: Add the golden conformance suite to contracts (39 Markdown/HTML pairs with expected warnings, and a Go runner with -update). The parser now handles YAML front matter (preserved, never rendered, line numbers unchanged), reports nested missing fields on the right line, and uses a library-independent message for invalid YAML. Spec: front matter rules and the frontmatter.syntax warning.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 00c4b27: Render the M1 components (statblock, readaloud, sidebar, pagebreak) to HTML from component definitions, with a breakability data attribute and warnings for invalid fields and attributes. Add the temporary M1 component definitions to contracts (`M1Components()` in Go, `m1Components` in TypeScript). The directive extension no longer has built-in components.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f4e4b9: Add the Goldmark directive extension: block and leaf directives with attributes, nesting, unclosed-block and unknown-component warnings. Spec: clarify which block a closing line closes, and that fenced code hides closing lines.
